# To Do List

- [ ] BGR block (sizing, calculations, etc.) - (current bgr sizing to be included in the report)
- [ ] Change BGR architecture (cascoded,etc. ) - to increase PSRR magnitude
- [ ] Fix PSRR across PVT
- [ ] Capture the behavior of LDO parameters across PVT corners (ex: overshoots, PSRR, PM, UGB, gain, load regulation, load transient, etc.)
- [ ] Update report with explanations for all theoretical calculations and individual block simulation results, compensation technique, sizings, etc.
- [ ] Add circuit diagrams to the report
- [ ] Do Trimming for 5 corners (cross corners not required)
- [ ] Design LDO without using Miller compensation, use other compensations
- [ ] Design for gain bandwidth = 2MHz and PM > 45 degrees
- [ ] Meet all the design specifications
- [x] Include enable switches for LDO 
- [ ] Create a symbol for the LDO
- [ ] Add a decoupling capacitor at the output node of BGR to prevent spikes in the output due to any spikes in vdd
